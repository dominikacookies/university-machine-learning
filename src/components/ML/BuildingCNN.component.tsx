        Building a convolutional neural network was the most exciting thing I
        have ever worked on. I was suprised by how relatively simple it was and
        the amount of resources available that I could get inspiration from for
        the architecture. I of course made many mistakes during this assignment,
        but the whole process was incredibly enjoyable and ignited a true
        passion in me to pursue this field further. I found the example CNN from
        one of the tutorials a very helpful starting point for this assignment.
        One thing I wish I had done sooner was to purchase Google Collab Pro. It
        was a game changer when it came to training some of the more advanced
        iterations of my models. What used to take 3 hours to complete would
        take less than 10 minutes with the improved resources the Pro plan
        offers.

        When first approaching this assignment I debated between building my own
        model from scratch or using an existing one and improving it further. As
        this was my first assignment in Python and the first time I was building
        a CNN I decided it was more important for my own learning to start from
        the ground up and build the model myself, even if that meant achieving a
        lower accuracy. This naturally made the process slightly harder and more
        frustrating as I paced back and forth between approaches, ways of
        splitting the validation data, sometimes forgetting to record results as
        I quickly moved between iterations to investigate what worked, and other
        times struggling to replicate them. My own excitement caught me here, as
        instead of diving into the code, in hindsight, I should have taken more
        time to do all my research upfront and create a plan for how I wanted to
        execute this assignment. Nevertheless, I am extremely proud of the
        result and glad to have learned so much from the process.
