        This was the second collaborative discussion of this module. I found
        this particularly interesting as it was a topic I myself was currently
        dwelving on. At the time, I was preparing to submit a talk proposal for
        a conference. I tried to use ChatGPT to generate a compelling
        description of my talk however found its response dissapointing, no
        matter how much I altered my prompts. I found that the model struggled
        to assert a voice that was both professional and relaxed, and seemed to
        often fall back on using very cheesy jokes to lighten an overly formal
        text. Ultimately, I ended up walking away from the tool and writing my
        own description, though admitedly somewhat inspired by some of the puns
        it managed to generate.

        In this assignmenet, I was suprised by how many of my peers chose to
        zoom in on how AI could cause job losses instead of how it could impact
        our creativity as humanity. I think this highlighted the fear many
        individuals have regarding the quick advancements in this space.
        Interestingly, in an interview with Google, Zanny Minton Beddoes, the
        Editor-in-Chief of The Economist highlighted how excited she is about AI
        possibly supporting editors in their roles instead of replacing them.
        Please see the video below if you're interested in watching the whole
        interview.

        The introduction of AI writers has been thrilling to observe,
        particularly as their uptake has sky-rocketed in the past years. I
        personally have found AI writers to be most helpful in supporting humans
        to write creative pieces instead of writing the entire thing themselves.
        Similarly, Clark et al. (2018) found that participants were most
        satisfied with the help of AI in the early stages of building their
        vision for a creative piece but often found their inputs irrelevant once
        that vision had been established. This may be because AI responses are
        not always accurate and AI-generated writing alone is not of incredibly
        high quality - the aforementioned study found that machine-written
        pieces were consistently voted worse than those crafted by humans.

        Since 2018, there have, of course, been large developments in the
        building of language models; however, as Hutsonâ€™s (2021) article
        suggests, AI writers are still yet to master the art of creating a
        unique and engaging voice when writing.

        The best support from AI can be recognised in the more administrative
        areas of writing, including translations and transcribing. Both of these
        can extend the original creatorâ€™s capabilities and help to make their
        content more accessible, whether that means transforming audio content
        into writing for consumption by those with hearing difficulties or
        translating important research so that individuals from different
        speaking countries can access the same information. But whilst there are
        many benefits to AI writers, as always, there are also big risks, one of
        these is the unintentional spread of inaccurate information through
        translations that donâ€™t capture the nuance of the original piece. I am
        keen to hear your thoughts on what other risks you perceive for AI
        writers and their impact on the industry!
