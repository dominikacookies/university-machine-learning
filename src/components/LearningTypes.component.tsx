        In one of the first units we explored AI and ML applications along with
        some of the learning types. This was a nice refresher from the previous
        modules and a great way to get started with the module. Below is a
        summary of my understanding.
      </p>
      <h3>unsupervised learning</h3>
      <p>
        Learning without labelled data. Models learn through identifying
        patterns, anomalies and relationships. One of the most commonly known
        algorithms that uses unsupervised learninig is clustering.
      </p>

      <h3>supervised learning</h3>
      <p>
        Learning with labelled data where the algorithm can learn how to
        identify data correctly by learning the mappings between the correct
        inputs and outputs. <br />
        Types include:
        <ul>
          <li>classification: classifies data (e.g. spam / not spam email)</li>
          <li>
            regression: predicts data (e.g. future house prices based on data
            from previous years)
          </li>
        </ul>
        Algoritms include:
        <ul>
          <li>decision trees</li>
          <li>association rules</li>
          <li>ANNs</li>
          <li>SVM</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h3>Reinforcement Learning</h3>
      <p>
        Similar to the psychological concept, prime example being Thorndikeâ€™s
        (1898) research, but with machienes. The agent learns by interacting
        with its environement and adjusts responses based on the received reward
        or penalty.
