      Based on the earlier literature review , I prepared a new research
      proposal. Below is the 'pitch' for it.
    </p>
    <h3>PITCH</h3>
    <p>
      The research will examine the financial impact of machine learning-based
      recommendation systems in fashion e-commerce, focusing on customer
      profiling and personalization. It aims to fill a gap by addressing
      financial implications, not just marketing metrics, and will help
      businesses assess if these systems increase profitability.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is crucial for businesses, especially startups, needing to determine
      whether adopting such technology is financially viable. Given tight
      competition and slim margins, understanding the true costs is essential
      for informed decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The study will collaborate with nine UK-based fashion e-commerce companies
      using Amazon Personalize to track setup, maintenance costs, and revenue
      generated. It will analyze data like the percentage of recommended product
      purchases and gather customer sentiment through interviews.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over three years, the first year will focus on recruitment and framework
      setup, followed by two years of data collection and analysis. The goal is
      to develop a framework businesses can use to evaluate the financial impact
      of their own recommendation systems.
