    <h3>Discussion Topic: Codes of Ethics and Professional Conduct</h3>
    <p>
      One of the first assignments in the Research Methods module was a
      collaborative discussion in which we explored the the case study of
      Corazon, a medical technology startup that builds heart health monitoring
      devices. The discussion oscillated around the duality in which the
      company's actions could be perceived.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the one hand, the company showed great professionalism in opening a bug
      bounty program and being honest about the vulnerabilities found in its
      system, adhering to the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)
      principle 1.3 on the honesty and trustworthiness of an organization. On
      the other hand, however, despite accepting a report of a bug which could
      reset a heart monitoring device, Corazon did not take any action to fix
      the bug. They worked with the researcher who identified it and together
      deemed it a ‘negligible’ risk. According to research by Anderson et al.
      (2021), the potential risks of ignoring seemingly minor vulnerabilities
      can be significant. This feels particularly true for medical devices. This
      led us to ask the question: who should have the authority to identify
      technology risks as negligible? Here, Danielle recommended consulting
      independent research bodies such as Qualysec (N.D) for advice to limit the
      impacts of conflict of interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      In summary, whilst we identified Corazon as having made an honourable
      decision in undertaking bug bounty programs to limit the risks this device
      may encounter, most of us felt that more could have been done to ensure
      the identified risks were appropriately resolved.

    <h3>Discussion Topic: Agent Communication Languages</h3>
    <h4>Accuracy of Information</h4>
    <p>
      The second discussion explored the ethical dilemma faced by a researcher
      whose data on the cereal "Whizzz" contradicted its claimed nutritional
      benefits. The key issue revolves around whether the researcher should
      present both the positive and negative findings or selectively analyse the
      data to cast the cereal in a more favourable light.
    </p>
    <p>
      One viewpoint argued that presenting both sets of results is crucial for
      maintaining research integrity. Selectively highlighting favourable
      outcomes, even without altering data, is seen as unethical because it can
      lead to misleading interpretations, ultimately harming the public. This
      perspective stresses the importance of providing a holistic and objective
      overview of findings, as researchers have a duty to ensure transparency
      and avoid compromising the credibility of their work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another perspective considers the temptation to present only positive
      results, acknowledging the short-term career benefits such as future
      business opportunities or recommendations from the company. However, this
      approach is cautioned against due to the long-term risks, including
      potential damage to the researcher's reputation if the selective reporting
      is uncovered, and the broader impact on public trust in science.
    </p>
    <p>
      The discussion also highlights the moral responsibility researchers hold
      over how their findings are used. Concerns were raised about the
      possibility that the company might only publicise the positive results,
      which could mislead consumers. The ethical implications of such actions,
      as well as the potential legal and social consequences, are explored,
      suggesting that transparency and objectivity should guide the researcher's
      actions for the benefit of both public health and long-term professional
      credibility.
