      A key assignment of this module was conducting a literature review. Below
      is the brief I wrote to base my research on.
    </p>
    <p>
      This literature review will explore the role of machine learning (ML) in
      customer profiling, focusing on how businesses can utilise ML to enhance
      personalisation efforts. In todayâ€™s data-driven world, ML offers a more
      dynamic and accurate approach to customer profiling than traditional
      methods, enabling businesses to predict consumer behaviour and tailor
      offerings in real-time. This topic is particularly relevant as industries
      like fashion, finance, and entertainment increasingly rely on personalised
      recommendations to stay competitive and improve customer engagement.

      The primary audience for this review includes business professionals and
      researchers interested in understanding the various ML approaches
      available for customer profiling, including supervised and unsupervised
      learning techniques. The review will also address the challenges
      businesses face, such as data quality and privacy concerns, while
      highlighting future research areas that can guide companies in effectively
      implementing these technologies for sustainable growth.
